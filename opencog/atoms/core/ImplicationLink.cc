	// variables is damn wrong.   XXX Why??  Not clear, but I think
	// what Nil wants is to have ImplicationLinks with free variables in
	// them, and the implcit scoping makes them non-free.
	//
	// Implication has a sugar form
	//
	// Implication
	//   <variable-declaration>
	//   <implicant>
	//   <implicand>
	//
	// which should always used, either using the sugar form above, or
	// using the non-sugar form by wrapping the implicant and implicand
	// bodies with Lambdas.
	//
	// Hack alert!!! If the variables are direct children of the
	// Implication then there are not implicitly scoped. This is a
	// temporary workaround for the bad code below. It really is a
	// huge hack that will not properly handle cases where some
	// variable are direct children and some others aren't. (??)
