/// This class is intended for holding single-valued state in a

/// after adding the new state; but this would not be thread-safe.

/// By "thread-safe", it is meant that any other thread observing the
/// AtomSpace will only see one StateLink: either the old one, or the
/// new one; they will never see two StateLinks, and they will never
/// see zero StateLinks.
