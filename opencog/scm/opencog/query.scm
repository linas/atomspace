 cog-value-is-type? TYPE-SPEC VALUE

  Type checker.  Returns true if `VALUE` is of type `TYPE-SPEC`.
  More precisely, returns true if `VALUE` will fit into the type
  specification given by `TYPE-SPEC`; that the value and the type
  specification can be connected. This is usefule for beta-reduction,
  (to check that some argument is reducible) or for pattern matching
  (searching).
")

(set-procedure-property! cog-type-match? 'documentation
"
 cog-type-match? LEFT RIGHT

  Type matcher. Returns true if `LEFT` can mate with `RIGHT`.
  Here, `LEFT` can be a type definition, and `RIGHT` can be
  another type defintion, or a value.  Mating is possible whenever
  `LEFT` is broader, less restricitve than `RIGHT`; equivalently
  if `RIGHT` is narrower than 'LEFT`.

  Mating types and arguments:
  LEFT == (Type 'ConceptNode)    RIGHT == (Concept \"foo\")  can mate.
  LEFT == (Type 'ConceptNode)    RIGHT == (Number 13)  cannot.

  Mating types and types:
  LEFT == (Type 'ConceptNode)    RIGHT == (Type 'ConceptNode)  can mate.

  Left is wider (polymorphic, in this case)
    LEFT == (TypeChoice (Type 'ConceptNode) (Type 'NumberNode))
    RIGHT == (Type 'NumberNode)  can mate.

  Function call arguments can be checked:
    LEFT == (Arrow (Type 'ConceptNode) (Type 'NumberNode))
    RIGHT == (Concept 'fooNode)  can mate.

    LEFT == (Arrow (Type 'ConceptNode) (Type 'NumberNode))
    RIGHT == (Number 13)  cannot.

  Function call chains can be checked:
    LEFT == (Arrow (Type 'ConceptNode) (Type 'NumberNode))
    RIGHT == (Type 'ConceptNode)  can mate.

  The following can mate, because LEFT accepts a concept as input,
  and RIGHT generates a concept as output:
    LEFT == (Arrow (Type 'ConceptNode) (Type 'NumberNode))
    RIGHT == (Arrow (Type 'EvaluationNode) (Type 'ConceptNode)

  Any type specification is valid: SignatureLinks, etc work too.

(set-procedure-property! cog-type-compose 'documentation
"
 cog-type-compose LEFT RIGHT

  Similar to cog-type-match?, but return the composition
  (beta-reduction) of the match. If the types do NOT match, an
  exception is thrown.  If the types do match, then, for many
  cases, the right side is the result.  The compostion of arrows,
  however, results either in a new arrow, or a simple return type.

  Examples:

  Function call arguments can be checked:
    LEFT == (Arrow (Type 'ConceptNode) (Type 'NumberNode))
    RIGHT == (Concept \"foo\")  can mate.
    result = (Type 'NumberNode)

  Function call chains:
    LEFT == (Arrow (Type 'ConceptNode) (Type 'NumberNode))
    RIGHT == (Type 'ConceptNode)  can mate.
    result = (Type 'NumberNode)

  The following can mate, because LEFT accepts a concept as input,
  and RIGHT generates a concept as output:
    LEFT == (Arrow (Type 'ConceptNode) (Type 'NumberNode))
    RIGHT == (Arrow (Type 'EvaluationLink) (Type 'ConceptNode)
    result = (Arrow (Type 'EvaluationLink) (Type 'NumberNode))
")
