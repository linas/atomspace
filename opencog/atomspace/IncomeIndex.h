/**
 * Implements a pool holding incoming sets for those Atoms that have
 * incoming sets. This pool is not currently used; it does not help
 * either with performance or with RAM usage!
 *
 * The original idea motivating this pool was the observation that
 * not all Atoms have incoming sets. Typically, only half of them do,
 * and so we should be able to save space by moving the InSetMap out
 * of the Atom, and into the pool, here. But this idea fails miserably,
 * and here's why.
 *
 * sizeof(InSetMap) = 48
 * sizeof(Handle) = 16
 * sizeof(std::pair<Handle, InSetMap>) = 64 = 16 + 48
 * sizeof std::map<Handle, InSetMap> entry approx 96 bytes total.
 *
 * The savings of reducing each Atom by 48 bytes is offset by requiring
 * approx 96 bytes to store the incoming sets for those Atoms that do
 * have them. So even if half of all Atoms don't have an incoming set,
 * there's no savings, because twice as much RAM is neded for the other
 * half.
 *
 * Measured on a typical dataset, the sfia dataset, average RAM per Atom
 * is 8 bytes **more**, using the IncomeIndex, here, than keeping the
 * incoming set inline with the Atom itself. That, plus using the index
 * here hurts performance by about 20%. In short, its a disaster. The
 * code here is left for reference, but it is not compiled.
 *
 * A pool is used to avoid lock contention. This is possible, because
 * each Handle has a deterministic hash, which can be used to identify
 * the pool.
