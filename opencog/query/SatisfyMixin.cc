/**
 * Loop over all groundings in all components of the pattern. That is,
 * given an ordered list of N sets, create a Cartesian product over that
 * list, by choosing one element from each set, and creating a tuple of
 * length N. The final Cartesian product is a set of all of these
 * tuples.  Note that there is a potential combinatorial explosion here,
 * as the total size is the product of the sizes of each of the
 * component.
 *
 * The loop is implemented recursively: The first set is expanded, then
 * the second set, etc. and so we recurse to depth N. Only at this
 * deepest call does a single tuple become available.
 *
 * During this expansion, filtering is applied. The filters (if any)
 * are called 'virtual links'. The prototypical example is the
 * GreaterThanLink. The virtual links return a true/false value, when
 * applied to the tuple (or to the currently-available fragment of the
 * tuple), thus accepting/rejecting that tuple.
 *
 * The virtual links are in 'virtuals', a partial set of groundings
 * are in 'var_gnds' and 'term_gnds', and a collection of possible
 * groundings for disconnected graph components are in 'comp_var_gnds'
 * and 'comp_term_gnds'.
 *
 * The recursion step terminates when comp_var_gnds, comp_term_gnds
 * are empty, at which point the actual unification is done.
 *
 * Return false if no solution is found, true otherwise.
 * (As always, 'false' means 'search some more' and 'true' means 'halt'.
 *
 * XXX FIXME: A major performance optimization is possible, to handle
 * the truly explosive combinatorial case. The optimization is to first
 * locate all of the variables in the virtual clauses, and perform the
 * recursion in the order of these variables. Once all of the variables
 * in a particular virtual clause have been found, that clause can be
 * evaluated on the spot. If it rejects the match, then one does not
 * have to recurse to the bitter end. This basically prunes the search
 * space. (Similar to how SAT solving works).
 *
 * This perf optimization has not been done because basically no one
 * uses the pattern engine to explore large, complex cartesian products
 * in this way.

/**
 * Ground (solve) a pattern; perform unification. That is, find one
 * or more groundings for the variables occurring in a collection of
 * clauses (a hypergraph). The hypergraph can be thought of as a
 * a 'predicate' which becomes 'true' when a grounding exists.
 *
 * The predicate is defined in terms of two hypergraphs: one is a
 * hypergraph defining a pattern to be grounded, and the other is a
 * list of bound variables in the first.
 *
 * The bound variables are, by convention, VariableNodes.  (The code in
 * the pattern match engine doesn't care whether the variable nodes are
 * actually of type VariableNode, and so can work with variables that
 * are any kind of node. However, the default callbacks do check for
 * this type. Thus, the restriction, by convention, that the variables
 * must be of type VariableNode.)  The list of bound variables is then
 * assumed to be listed using the ListLink type. So, for example:
 *
 *    ListLink
 *        VariableNode "variable 1"
 *        VariableNode "another variable"
 *
 * The pattern hypergraph is assumed to be a list of "clauses", where
 * each "clause" should be thought of as the tree defined by the outgoing
 * sets in it.  The below assumes that the list of clauses is specified
 * by means of an AndLink, so, for example:
 *
 *     AndLink
 *        SomeLink ....
 *        SomeOtherLink ...
 *
 * The clauses are assumed to be connected by variables, i.e. each
 * clause has a variable that also appears in some other clause.  Even
 * more strongly, it is assumed that there is just one connected
 * component; the code below throws an error if there is more than one
 * connected component.  The reason for this is to avoid unintended
 * combinatoric explosions: the grounding of any one (connected)
 * component is completely independent of the grounding of any other
 * component.  So, if there are two components, and one has N groundings
 * and the other has M groundings, then the two together trivially have
 * MxN groundings. Its worse if there are 4, 4... components. Rather
 * than stupidly reporting a result MxNx... times, we just throw an
 * error, and let the user decide what to do.
 *
 * The grounding proceeds by requiring each clause to match some part
 * of the atomspace (i.e. of the universe of hypergraphs stored in the
 * atomspace). When a solution is found, PatternMatchCallback::solution
 * method is called, and it is passed two maps: one mapping the bound
 * variables to their groundings, and the other mapping the pattern
 * clauses to their corresponding grounded clauses.
 *
 * Note: the pattern matcher itself doesn't use the atomspace, or care
 * if the groundings live in the atomspace; it can search anything.
 * However, the default callbacks do use the atomspace to find an
 * initial starting point for the search, and thus the search defacto
 * happens on the atomspace.  This restriction can be lifted by tweaking
 * the callback that initially launches the search.
 *
 * At this time, the list of clauses is understood to be a single
 * disjunct; that is, all of the clauses must be simultaneously
 * satisfied.  A future extension could allow the use of MatchOrLinks
 * to support multiple exclusive disjuncts. See the README for more info.
