* Russ Harmer and Eugenia Oshurko "Reversibility and composition of
  rewriting in hierarchies", (2020)
  https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02869865

  The idea here is that sequences of rules can be applied, and then they
  can be reversed. This enableds back-tracking on a rule system.

* Scott Garrabrant, Tsvi Benson-Tilsen, Andrew Critch, Nate Soares,
  Jessica Taylor "Logical Induction" (2016)
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03543

  "We present a computable algorithm that assigns probabilities to
  every logical statement in a given formal language, and refines
  those probabilities over time."


* document Log2Link
* demo for dot product
* unit test for dot product acumultate
* slides into README
* slides into blog post
* dot product into fast matrix
* ChoiceLink/IdenticalLink
* atomspace smart pointer
* atomspace multi-children
* atomspace multi-search.

* empahsize: generalization is what the voting algorithm does
* keywords: novelty

* random walk through the graph, however, look-ahead by spreading
  attention by weights - this needs the attention allocation redisign.
  This is for generation.

* Use a small collection of words from text chat to deposit attention
  into the network. Then trace throught grammatically network crawls
  throught the net. Do this on an IRC chat channel.

* Document the quanutm collapse idea in the current generation
  code base README

* Multiple input streams need multiple pair correlation counters
  and need to be distinguished. Each input stream needs it's own
  tag type. The tag type is not WordNode any more but Stream1Node
  and Stream2Node or ... needs to be flexible but compact.

* Move away from word-node to generic item-node...!? Only to avoid
  collisions between type defintions? But want a node-type per-stream.
  or instead
  (TagLink (TagNode "tag-name") (ItemNode "word"))
  where TagNode is a kind-of DirectionNode and/or PredicateNode
  ItemNode is a type of ConnectorNode
  TagLink is a Connector

  Thus, (WordNode "foo") is syntactic sugar for
  (TagLink (TagNode "natural language word") (ItemNode "foo"))

word-nodes are item nodes
direction-links are before and after. in a given stream

cross-stream pairs need:
item of one stream  (so a tag link)
item of another stream
a before-simultaneous-after marker for that pair.
