* Russ Harmer and Eugenia Oshurko "Reversibility and composition of
  rewriting in hierarchies", (2020)
  https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02869865

  The idea here is that sequences of rules can be applied, and then they
  can be reversed. This enableds back-tracking on a rule system.

* Scott Garrabrant, Tsvi Benson-Tilsen, Andrew Critch, Nate Soares,
  Jessica Taylor "Logical Induction" (2016)
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03543

  "We present a computable algorithm that assigns probabilities to
  every logical statement in a given formal language, and refines
  those probabilities over time."


* document Log2Link
* demo for dot product
* unit test for dot product acumultate
* slides into README
* slides into blog post
* dot product into fast matrix
* ChoiceLink/IdenticalLink
* atomspace smart pointer
* atomspace multi-children
* atomspace multi-search.

* empahsize: generalization is what the voting algorithm does
* keywords: novelty

* random walk through the graph, however, look-ahead by spreading
  attention by weights - this needs the attention allocation redisign.
  This is for generation.

* Use a small collection of words from text chat to deposit attention
  into the network. Then trace throught grammatically network crawls
  throught the net. Do this on an IRC chat channel.

* Document the quanutm collapse idea in the current generation
  code base README
