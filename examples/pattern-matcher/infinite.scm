; infinite.scm -- Infinite recursion
;
; This demo assumes you've read and understood the `recrusive.scm` demo.
;
; This demo illustrates how create infinite-recursive queries that don't
; blow out the stack. Basically, the final step of the recusion is
; replaced by a kind-of-like tail-recursive step, which can be thought
; of as a kind-of-like a call to a continuation.
;

; ----------
; This uses the same demo upper ontology as `recursive.scm`, except
; this will be modified to be circular. Thus, attempting to determine
; inheritance will lead to infinite regress.

(Inheritance (Concept "thing") (Concept "Ben"))

; ----------
; Just as in the `recursive.scm` demo, inheritance is implemented as
; 'transitive closure'. This is the idea that given some relation
; R(x,y) (in this case, the InheritanceLink) that either one has
; R(a,b) is directly, immediately true for elements a,b or that
; there is a transitive chain
;
;     R(a,x) & R(x,y) & ... & R(z,b)
;
; for some intermediate elements x,y,...,z. The & here denotes logical
; 'and'; each of the R must be logical-true.
;
; The above can be implemented programmatically by defining a recursive
; relation S(x,y) as follows:
;
;    S(x,y) := R(x,y) or (R(x,w) & S(w,y))
;
; The := symbol here is the definition of S. It is recursive in that the
; definition makes reference to itself. It just says that either S is R,
; or that we can peel off one level, and try again.
;
; The definition below is explained in detail in `recursive.scm`

;;;						(DefinedPredicate "recursive relation")
;;;						(List (Variable "middle") (Variable "that"))))))))
;;;
;;;; Let's test it out. Does it work? The query below returns (stv 1 1)
;;;; that is, 'logical-true', because the inheritance chain between 'Ben'
;;;; and 'animal' is finite in length.
;;;(cog-evaluate!
;;;	(Evaluation
;;;		(DefinedPredicate "recursive relation")
;;;		(List (Concept "Ben") (Concept "animal"))))
;;;
;;;; If we try to verify that 'Ben' isn't 'foobar', there is a problem: the
;;;; attempted transitive closure never ends, because 'foobar' cannot be
;;;; found in the chain.  Running the below results in an error message
;;;; (currently, the error is about a "Transient space memleak!") This is
;;;; because, at eash step through the inheritance chain, a temporary
;;;; AtomSpace is created, to be used as a scratchpad (a Kripke frame, to
;;;; be formal). Eventually, one runs out of room for this infinite regress
;;;; of scratchpads, and an error results.
