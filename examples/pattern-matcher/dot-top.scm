; Development/test version.

; The QueryLink not only performs searches, but it can apply rewrite
; rules to the results. These re-write rules can generate (numeric)
; Values, which are returned to the caller.  This example illustrates
; a query that returns two vectors of numbers, which are multiplied
; and accumulated, resulting in a dot-product of the two.

; Define a pair of vectors. One vector is called "dog", the other is
; called "cat". The basis elements of both vectors are "has legs",
; "has nose" and so on. The numeric value for that basis element is
; stored in a CountTruthValue attached to each.
